# R-Workshop Intro To R Syntax

Material for intro to R Syntax workshop

Using the Rproj file and Rstudio open the Rmd file for each part.
Compile them with the Run Document button.
This created a shiny app that is fully contained and interactive to work on the tutorial material.
The code chuncks are fully ineractive R sessions and can be made to keep state from orevious chunks via learnr references.
This provides a workshop with zero-time spent on setup and leaving the time and attention to focus on R syntax exclusively.
