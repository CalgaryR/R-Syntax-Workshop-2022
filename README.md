# R-Workshop Intro To R Syntax

Material for intro to R Syntax workshop

Using the Rproj file and Rstudio open the Rmd file for each module.
Compile them with the Run Document button.
This created a shiny app that is fully contained and interactive to work on the tutorial material.
The code chunks are fully interactive R sessions and can be made to keep state from previous chunks via learnr references.
This provides a workshop with zero-time spent on setup and leaving the time and attention to focus on R syntax exclusively.

So far 4 iterations of these workshops have given feedback to  present a more modular approach to each basic syntax concept starting from basic operators, variables, and built-in functions to data types, data structures, and ultimately user functions and basics of control flow for  programming.
