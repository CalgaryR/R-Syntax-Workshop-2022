<!-- ======================== -->
## 🟢 What you will learn
<!-- ======================== -->

By the end of this tutorial, you will know the basics of matrices and arrays in R. 
You will know the properties of a matrix, when you need to use matrices, how to construct them, and how to modify them.
You will extend the concepts you learned about vectors to matrices. 
Specifically you will re-visit recycling, sub-setting using the `$` syntax, the `[` syntax, or using logical masks, and will revisit the introduction of `NA`s.

Finally you will learn what arrays are and the type of multi-dimensional data that most typically they are used to represent.

<!-- ======================== -->
## 🟢 About this tutorial
<!-- ======================== -->

This introductory tutorial about the base R syntax can be used as a presentation by an instructor or as a self-study guide. 
It contains explanations, fully functional code boxes, and quizzes that make it interactive. 
When time allows during a guided session, the student can edit and execute code to test how the syntax works. 
This provides invaluable hands-on feedback. 
The instructor may also ask short questions regarding the material.
Should you fall behind or need more time for the exercises and quizzes, please complete them after the live session.
This is very important in order to cement the concepts and challenge your understanding.

The emphasis of this tutorial is on why R works the way it does and less on being a reference manual or a source of recipes. In doing so we hope to get you excited about this useful and expressive language. R was designed from the ground up to be vectorized and object oriented. Its aim is to be useful for both experts and beginners with the need to do computational statistics, data analysis and data visualization tasks.

Several sources describe the three types of R Syntax [@RSyntax-Cheatsheet], [@RSyntaxComparison-Cheatsheet]: the dollar sign, the formula, and the Tidyverse. These syntaxes are interchangeable, the important thing is to be consistent when using them. The formula syntax tends to be more compact but less readable while the Tidyverse syntax is more readable but also more verbose. We will focus on the dollar syntax.
<!-- Later we introduce the formula syntax and finally the tidyverse syntax. -->

This tutorial was built entirely in R using a package called `learnr`. It was compiled to an html document using Rmarkdown syntax and the `Knitr` package. If you receive the source code and have RStudio, you can render it as a fully interactive web page. Using an Rstudio (Posit) solution it can also be deployed on a ShinyR server. You can also do these things and much more if you move forward in your R journey.

Finally, if you are following this material in a browser, every time you reopen the tutorial, it will be in the same state you left it the last time you worked on it. That means the code you have run, the answers to the quizzes you have worked, and the sections you have visited will be remembered. If you want to reset this information, erasing all of your previous history, press the `Start Over` option at the bottom left on the main panel.

Let's get started.





## ✅️ Constructing matrices

Matrices are the two-dimensional extensions of vectors. They must store elements of the same type, so coercion rules will apply if they do not meet this requirement.


### 🟢 An example

A matrix of six integer values would be represented graphically as:


```{r matrix, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/matrix.png", dpi = 106)
```

And in code it would be constructed with:
```{r matrix-construction, exercise=TRUE}
matrix(c(5, -1, 3, 0, -4, 1), ncol = 3, nrow = 2, byrow = T)
```


The function `matrix()` takes a vector with a variable number of arguments and a number of other parameters that inform the function how to construct the matrix from the vector. R by default populates the matrix _column-wise_, thus the argument `byrow = TRUE` effectively instructs it  to fill in the elements _row-wise_.


## ✅️ The details

```{r matrix-details, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/matrix_fill.png", dpi = 106)
```



## ✅️ Matrix manipulation

Matrices can be seen as a vertical stack of row vectors or a horizontal stack column vectors, from this perspective, _matrix subsetting_ is a direct extension of the same operation on vectors.

Try to answer the questions with your code.

```{r matrix-example, exercise = TRUE}
(x <- matrix(c(5, -1, 3, 0, -4, 1), ncol = 3, nrow = 2, byrow = T))
# extract the element on the first row and third column of x

# subtract the first element from the first row from the first element of the second row

# find the dimensions of x

```

```{r matrix-example-hint}
# extract the element on the first row and third column of x
x[1,3]
# subtract the first element from the first row from the first element of the second row
x[2,1] - x[1,1]
# find the dimensions of x
dim(x)
```

If the named argument `byrow = T` were not there, R would have constructed the matrix on a column first order, this is a matrix default. Verify this for yourself:

```{r matrix-example-bycolumn, exercise = TRUE}
(y <- matrix(c(5, -1, 3, 0, -4, 1), ncol = 3, nrow = 2))
# extract the element on the first row and third column of x
y[1,3]
# subtract the first element from the first row from the first element of the second row
y[2,1] - y[1,1]
# find the dimensions of x
dim(y)
```

As a task, find out how to name the rows and columns in a matrix. There is an example in the module on lists in this same series of workshops (see **Using lists of vectors** in workshop Part 4: Lists).

## ✅️ Sub-setting a matrix

A matrix can be subset via positions and via values, either using logical masks or column names. The same operator `[]` is used for both dimensions of the matrix, separated by a comma inside the brackets. Just like when sub-setting vectors, a matrix can de subset with vectors of positions to extract subsets by row(s) and column(s). For example, to subset the first row and the second column of a given matrix do as follows.

```{r subsetting-matrix-rows, exercise=TRUE}
(m <- matrix(rep(c(rep(1:2,times=2), rep(3:4,times=2)),2), byrow = T, nrow = 4))
m[1,]
m[,2]
```
```{r, setup-subsetting-matrices}
m <- matrix(rep(c(rep(1:2, times=2), rep(3:4, times=2)),2), byrow = T, nrow = 4)
```

Now extract a sub-matrix defined by the first two rows and the third and fourth columns of the original matrix:

```{r, subsetting-matrix-from-within-matrix, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="setup-subsetting-matrices"}
m[1:2, 3:4]
```

## ✅️ Useful matrix functions

There are very useful functions to deal with matrices. Let's just mention a few here.

```{r sum-rows-cols-matrix, exercise=TRUE}
(m <- matrix(c(5, -1, 3, 0, -4, 1), ncol = 3, nrow = 2, byrow = T))
# add the elements of each row 
rowSums(m)
# add the elements of each column
colSums(m)
```



```{r matrix-m}
m <- matrix(c(5, -1, 3, 0, -4, 1), ncol = 3, nrow = 2, byrow = T)
```


Append a new row to the matrix at different positions.


```{r add-row-to-matrix, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="matrix-m"}
m
print("Append a  row with the number 6 to matrix m with 'rbind(m, rep(6, times=3))'")
rbind(m, rep(6, times=3))
print("append the new row at the top instead with 'rbind(rep(6, times=3), m)'")
rbind(rep(6, times=3), m)
print("insert a row in between first and second row with 'rbind(m[1,], rep(6, times=3), m[2,])'")
rbind(m[1,], rep(6, times=3), m[2,])
```
Append a new column to the matrix at different positions.


```{r add-column-to-matrix, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="matrix-m"}
m
print("append a column with the number 6 to matrix m with 'cbind(m, rep(6, 2))'")
cbind(m, rep(6, 2))
print("append the new column at the beginning instead with 'cbind(rep(6, 2), m)'")
cbind(rep(6, 2), m)
print("insert a column in between first and second columns with 'cbind(m[,1], rep(6,2), m[,2:3])'")
cbind(m[,1], rep(6,2), m[,2:3])
```


## ✅️ Mask: Vector or Matrix?

If you remember the rules of recycling and the fact that by default matrices are traversed element-wise along the columns from top to bottom, let's multiply a <span style="color:blue">matrix</span> by a <span style="color:blue">_vector_</span>.
Have in mind that by default these operations are element-wise.
How can you explain the result below?

```{r, multiply-matrix-times-vector, exercise=TRUE}
# the following will make the pseudo random number generation produce the same result every time for reproducibility
set.seed(673912) # this is an arbitrary number, nothing special about it
# sample 16 integers with replacement from 1 to 99
values <- sample.int(n = 99, size = 16, replace = TRUE)
(m <- matrix(values, nrow = 4))
print("a mask to nullify the 4th row of the matrix: '( zero.to.4th.row <- c(1,1,1,0) )'")
( zero.to.4th.row <- c(1,1,1,0) )
print("The result after applying the mask: 'm * zero.to.4th.row'")
m * zero.to.4th.row
```

## 💚 Recycling applied ️

The vector passed as second argument to the multiplication operator is used by R to create a matrix using the default column-wise order. Recycling kicks in because the vector is too short to fill up the matrix. 


```{r matrix-by-recycling, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/matrix_multiplication.png", dpi = 86)
```

## 🛑 Time to practice

quiz(
    # https://rdrr.io/github/timelyportfolio/sortableR/man/question_rank.html

               m * matrix(rep(c(-1,2,1,0),3), ncol = 3)

    correct = "Correct, you nailed it. Matrix multiplication is your thing!",
    incorrect = "Perhaps if you picture the vector used in the second matrix as a column and try again?",
    allow_retry = TRUE,

    options = sortable::sortable_options(),

  ),
  question_checkbox("What is the result of the following operation?:

    answer("The null matrix", correct = TRUE),
    answer("         [,1] [,2] [,3]
     [1,]    0    0    0
     [2,]    0    0    0
     [3,]    0    0    0", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Error in m + matrix(c(1), nrow = 4) : non-conformable arrays", correct = FALSE, message = 'R can deal with this better than you think.'),
    answer("Error in m + c(1) : non-conformable arrays", correct = FALSE, message = 'R would know the difference!'),
    answer("     [,1] [,2] [,3]
     [1,]    1    0    0
     [2,]    0    0    0
     [3,]    0    0    0", correct = FALSE, message = 'R can do this, keep trying!'),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    random_answer_order = TRUE,
    correct = "You figured out that R turns the 1 into a matrix of the required size!"
  )
)
```


## ✅️ Arrays

Arrays are the natural extension of vector and matrices to n-dimensions.

```{r array, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/array.png", dpi = 86)
```

The image illustrates a three-dimensional array with rows, columns, and frames. 

```{r arrray-creation, echo=T}
array(1:18, dim = c(2, 3, 3))
```

Here we  created a tensor of 2 rows by 3 columns by 3 frames with the numbers 1 to 18. 
Study the output to verify it.

A typical use for arrays is to represent color images by storing each of the three values of color for each pixel on a separate frame. 
The resulting array representation for a pixel at the location $(x_i,y_j)$ with $\text{rgb}=(z_1,z_2,z_3)$ would be $(x_i,y_j,z_1)$, $(x_i,y_j,z_2)$, and $(x_i,y_j,z_3)$.
Additional information about the pixels, like transparency alpha-values can be mapped on to additional frames like $(x_i,y_j,\alpha_{i,j})$ where $0\geq \alpha_{i,j} \geq 1$.

Please note that arrays can only store a homogeneous data type, therefore the rules of coercion will apply when assigning values.
In general have in mind that in order to avoid information loss, R will try to coerce all values in an array to the most general type.
For example, if there are logical and integer values in the same array they will all be coerced to numeric without any user intervention.

These data structures are very useful in image recognition using deep learning.
In that application, each layer of a neural network can apply tensor operations on the original image to identify features like edges or colour/shade boundaries.


Let's build a $2\times2\times3$ array with random values between 0 and 64.



```{r, 2by2by3array, exercise=TRUE}
set.seed(673912)
( a <- array(sample.int(64,size = 12,replace = TRUE), 
             dim = c(2,2,3),
             dimnames = list(c(),c(),c('red','green','blue'))) )
```

Now let's build a logical mask to nullify the second frame and apply it to the original array.

```{r, logical-mask-for-an-array, exercise=TRUE}
(mask <- array(rep(1,12), 
               dim = c(2,2,3),
               dimnames = list(c(),c(),c('red','green','blue'))))
print("Introduce a frame of zeros")
(mask[,,'green']<- matrix(rep(0,4), ncol = 2))
```

Now apply the mask to the original array.


```{r, setup-for-array-mask, exercise=FALSE}
set.seed(673912)
a <- array(sample.int(64,size = 12,replace = TRUE), 
             dim = c(2,2,3),
             dimnames = list(c(),c(),c('red','green','blue'))) 
mask <- array(rep(1,12), 
               dim = c(2,2,3),
               dimnames = list(c(),c(),c('red','green','blue')))
mask[,,'green'] <- matrix(rep(0,4), ncol = 2)
```


```{r, apply-mask-on-array, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="setup-for-array-mask"}
a * mask
```


## ✅️ Date and Time

Let's take a side tour at this point in our R journey to explore the non-trivial task of modelling date and time.

In R these concepts are represented as vectors of `double` with special classes that meet different needs. Dr. Spector's notes bring a clear and easily accessible summary of the available classes for date and time in R [@DatesAndTimesInR].

  1. The function `as.date` handles dates without times.
  2. The library `chron` handles dates and times without time zones.
  3. The base-R classes `POSIXct` and `POSIXlt` allow for date and times with control for time zones.

The package `lubridate`, published in 2011 [@JSSv040i03] brought to R a consistent and easy framework to do arithmetic on dates and time for data analysis.

We will focus on base-R `as.date` and the `POSIXct` and `POSIXlt` classes.

### 🟢 Dates in base R

To create a date without time one can use text and a format string using the following conventions.

<center>
<table border="1">
<tr><td>Code</td><td>Value</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>%d</tt></td><td>Day of the month (decimal number)</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>%m</tt></td><td>Month (decimal number)</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>%b</tt></td><td>Month (abbreviated)</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>%B</tt></td><td>Month (full name)</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>%y</tt></td><td>Year (2 digit)</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>%Y</tt></td><td>Year (4 digit)</td></tr></table>
</center>

```{r, creating-simple-date-withot-time, exercise=TRUE}
# let's use the default format: 4-digit year, 2-digit month, 2-digit day, separated by either - or /
c(as.Date("2021-2-16"),  as.Date('2021/02/17'))
# Lets add formats: %d= Day as a decimal number; %
as.Date("February 16, 2021", format = '%B %d, %Y')
as.Date('02.16.21', format = '%m.%d.%y')
```

If you need to read a date written in a non-standard convention, the named parameter `format` of the function `as.Date` is very convenient, see more examples in [@DatesAndTimesInR].

`Date` objects are stored as the number of days since January 1, 1970. There are functions to compute on dates, for instance to return the day of the week a certain date corresponds to. There are similarly functions to compute the month, day and the  quarter corresponding to a date.

```{r, examples-compute-stuff-from-date, exercise=TRUE}
famous_events <- c(Storming_of_the_Bastille=as.Date('14 July 1789', format="%d %B %Y"),
                   First_Canadian_Constitution_Act=as.Date('29th March 1867', format="%dth %B %Y"),
                   First_inauguration_of_Obama=as.Date('January 20, 2009', format='%B %d, %Y'))
t(weekdays(famous_events))
t(months((famous_events)))
quarters(famous_events)
famous_events["Storming_of_the_Bastille"] > famous_events['First_Canadian_Constitution_Act']
```

### 🟢 More accurate time

If you need a representation of time to the nearest second then the POSIX date classes store times to the nearest second. There are two:

  * **POSIXct**: stores date/time values as the number of seconds since January 1, 1970.
  * **POSIXlt**: stores date/time values as a list with elements for second, minute, hour, day, month, and year, among others.

The usual choice is to use POSIXct unless you really need the list version. 
The creation of instances is done with the functions `as.POSIXct` and `as.POSIXlt`. 
There is a standard format for the date and the time parts of the input, execute the code below to confirm this.

```{r, create-dates-as-POSIX, exercise=TRUE}
# for better results all dates should have date and time parts
text_dates <- c('2021-02-16 16:00', '2021-02-16 16:45', '2021-02-16 17:00:01')
as.POSIXct(text_dates)
```
Try to answer what happens if you don't specify the time portion when constructing the vector of POSIXct date-time objects. 


To tell R the input is in non-standard form use the function `strptime` and the formatting symbols from the following table:

<center>
<table border="1">
<tbody><tr><td>Code</td><td>Meaning</td><td>Code</td><td>Meaning</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>%a</tt></td><td>Abbreviated weekday</td><td><tt>%A</tt></td><td>Full weekday</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>%b</tt></td><td>Abbreviated month</td><td><tt>%B</tt></td><td>Full month</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>%c</tt></td><td>Locale-specific date and time</td><td><tt>%d</tt></td><td>Decimal date</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>%H</tt></td><td>Decimal hours (24 hour)</td><td><tt>%I</tt></td><td>Decimal hours (12 hour)</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>%j</tt></td><td>Decimal day of the year</td><td><tt>%m</tt></td><td>Decimal month</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>%M</tt></td><td>Decimal minute</td><td><tt>%p</tt></td><td>Locale-specific AM/PM</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>%S</tt></td><td>Decimal second</td><td><tt>%U</tt></td><td>Decimal week of the year (starting on Sunday)</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>%w</tt></td><td>Decimal Weekday (0=Sunday)</td><td><tt>%W</tt></td><td>Decimal week of the year (starting on Monday)</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>%x</tt></td><td>Locale-specific Date</td><td><tt>%X</tt></td><td>Locale-specific Time</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>%y</tt></td><td>2-digit year</td><td><tt>%Y</tt></td><td>4-digit year</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>%z</tt></td><td>Offset from GMT</td><td><tt>%Z</tt></td><td>Time zone (character)</td></tr></tbody></table>
</center>

```{r, inputing-time-POSIX-non-standard-format, exercise=TRUE}
(started_YYC = strptime('16/Feb/2021T16:01:00',format='%d/%b/%YT%H:%M:%S'))
(started_LON = strptime('16/Feb/2021T16:01:00',format='%d/%b/%YT%H:%M:%S',tz = 'UTC'))
started_LON - started_YYC
