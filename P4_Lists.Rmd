## What you will learn

<!-- ======================== -->

By the end of this tutorial, you will know the basics of lists in R.
We will cover the nature of lists, their core role in the R language, the syntax to construct them, how to modify them, and how to inspect them.
You will reuse syntax from vectors and matrices that extend to lists.
Specifically you will re-visit recycling, sub-setting using the the `[` syntax or using logical masks, and we will introduce a new operator to select or sub-set lists, the `[[` operator.

Finally we will put in context the fact that a linear model is built upon a list in the R language.

<!-- ======================== -->

## About this tutorial

<!-- ======================== -->

This introductory tutorial about the base R syntax can be used as a presentation by an instructor or as a self-study guide.
It contains explanations, fully functional code boxes, and quizzes that make it very interactive.
If time allows during a guided session, the student can execute code to prod and test how the syntax works providing invaluable hands-on feedback.
The instructor may also ask short questions regarding the material.
Should you fall behind or need more time, please do so after the live session.
Actually this is very important in order to cement the concepts and test your understanding.

The emphasis of this tutorial is on why R works the way it does and less on being a reference manual or a source of recipes.
In doing so we hope to get you excited about this useful and expressive language.
R was designed from the ground up to be vectorized and object oriented.
Its aim is to be useful for both experts and beginners with the need to do computational statistics, data analysis and data visualization tasks.

Dr. Amelia McNamara describes three types of R Syntax [@RSyntax-Cheatsheet]: the dollar sign, the formula, and the Tidyverse.
These syntax are interchangeable, the important thing is to be consistent when using them.
The formula syntax tends to be more compact but less readable while the Tidyverse syntax is more readable but also more verbose.
We will initially focus on the dollar sign syntax.
Later we introduce the formula syntax and finally the tidyverse syntax.

This tutorial was built entirely in R using a package called `learnr`.
It was compiled to an html document using Rmarkdown syntax and the `Knitr` package.
If you receive the source code and have RStudio, you can render it as a fully interactive web page.
Using an Rstudio solution it can also be deployed on a ShinyR server.
You can also do these things and much more if you move forward in your R journey.

Finally, if you are following this material on a browser, every time you reopen this page the tutorial will be in the previous state you left it the last time you worked on it.
If you want to reset your answers and the code you've run on the exercises, erasing all of your previous history, press the `Start Over` option at the bottom left on the main panel.

Let's get started.


<!-- ====================== -->

## What are Lists?

<!-- ====================== -->

Lists are one-dimensional vector objects that can store information of heterogeneous type, a list can even contain other lists.
R's linear model object, with constructor `lm()`, is a list.
Lists are very versatile and are at the center of R's model and data handling capabilities.

## Constructing lists

Here is a graphical representation of a list with three components.

```{r list, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/list.png", dpi = 96)
```

And here is your turn to create it with R code using the constructor `list()`.
Try to complete the exercise before looking at the hint.

```{r list-constructor, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=7}
my_list <- list(some_strings = c("hello", "world"),
                some_numbers = 10:15,
                some_booleans = c(T,T,T,F))
# check the names

# extract the first element of the list
```

```{r list-constructor-hint}
attributes(my_list)
names(my_list)
my_list[[1]]
```

## Accessing the elements of a list {#accessing-the-elements-of-a-list}

Did you notice the use of double square brackets, `[[]]` to access the vectors stored in the list of the previous section?
Had you chosen to use single brackets `[]` the result would have been a named list of one vector as its only element, try it now if you did not before:

```{r, subsettingListsSingleBracketSetup}
my_list <- list(some_strings = c("hello", "world"),
          some_numbers = 10:15,
          some_booleans = c(T,T,T,F))
```

```{r, subsetting-lists-single-bracket, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=7, exercise.setup="subsettingListsSingleBracketSetup"}
my_list <- list(some_strings = c("hello", "world"),
          some_numbers = 10:15,
          some_booleans = c(T,T,T,F))
class(my_list[1])
my_list[1]
class(my_list[[1]])
my_list[[1]]
```

The list class is kind of a super set of the vector class, thus R's coercion philosophy will be to coerce vectors into lists whenever confronted with the dilemma.
In the following case, attempting to create a vector given a list and a vector, first coerces the vector into a list (a list is a more general concept than a vector) and then merges the two lists into a single one.

```{r, coercion-of-vector-to-list, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=2}
new_object <- c(list(1,"a"), c(0,2,4))
new_object
```

In general, passing two or more lists as arguments to `c()` merges them all into a single list.

<!-- =========================== -->

## Appending a new element {#appending-a-new-element}

<!-- =========================== -->

In order to append a new element to an existing list the `c()` operator works well.
The caveat is to use the `list()` constructor around the new element.
This is useful to prevent the flattening of a vector into individual list elements when appended.
It creates a new object leaving the original list unchanged.

```{r, new-element-appending-in-new-list, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=9, exercise.setup="subsettingListsSingleBracketSetup"}
print(paste("length of original list =",length(my_list)))
# this creates a new list
(new_list <- c(my_list, list(rep(-1,3))))
# check the length of the original list
print(paste("length of original list is still",length(my_list), "after appending to new list"))
# check the length of the new list
print(paste("length of new list =",length(new_list)))
# check that the last element is the vector we wanted to insert
new_list[[length(new_list)]]
```

The `[[]]` operator allows insertion of new elements of any type into a list, that means no coercion will be used.
This is the similar functionality of the operator `[]` for vectors.

```{r, new-element-of-list-appending-in-place, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=7, exercise.setup="subsettingListsSingleBracketSetup"}
print(paste("length of original list =",length(my_list)))
# this modifies in place
my_list[[length(my_list) + 1]] <- rep(-1,3)
# check the new length of the list
print(paste("length of original list is now",length(my_list), "after appending in place"))
# check that the last element is the vector we wanted to insert
my_list[[length(my_list)]]
```

<!-- =============================== -->

## Accessing nested lists

<!-- =============================== -->

When passing lists as argument to the `list()` constructor there is no need for coercion of any kind.
Try the following code to make sure you grasp the concept.
This will become very important to do amazing data analysis later.

Would you have thought that R could come in handy for that party you are planning for friends and family?
The list of items for the party can be nested within the list of party items, how convenient!

We can use the `$` operator to reference the elements of the list by name as suggested in the hint of the following exercise.

```{r list-nesting, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=14}
# get organized for that party you are throwing for friends and family
party_items = list( drinks = c("pop", "wine", "beer", "water"),
                    furniture = c(chairs = 8, tables = 2, hammocks = 1))

(to_do_list <- list(guests = c("Uncle Bob", "Friendly neighbour", "Joe Best"),
                   invited = c(F,F,T),
                   items = party_items))

# extract the party items from the 'to_do_list' and display the drinks to buy

```

```{r list-nesting-hint}
to_do_list[[3]][[1]]
# equivalent but using the dollar operator
to_do_list[[3]]$drinks
# using the dollar operator all the way
to_do_list$items$drinks
```
 As the reader might have noticed, using the `$` operator is equivalent to using the `[[ ]]` operators for subsetting a list.



<!-- =============================== -->

## Referencing elements by name

<!-- =============================== -->

The `$` operator can be used to reference named elements of a list.


Single square brackets extract a list from position 2 of the `to_do_list` below. Double square brackets extract a vector of the elements of type logical stored in the list at that same position.

```{r, setupListOfLists}
party_items = list( drinks = c("pop", "wine", "beer", "water"),
                    furniture = c(chairs = 8, tables = 2, hammocks = 1))

to_do_list <- list(guests = c("Uncle Bob", "Friendly neighbour", "Joe Best"),
                   invited = c(F,F,T),
                   items = party_items)
```


```{r, example-list-from-a-list, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=8, exercise.setup="setupListOfLists"}
# these two options are equivalent and return single element lists
to_do_list[2]
to_do_list["invited"]
class(to_do_list[2])
class(to_do_list["invited"])
# compare to the class of the object returned by
class(to_do_list[[2]])
class(to_do_list$invited)
```

```{r listDollarSetup}
party_items = list( drinks = c("pop", "wine", "beer", "water"),
                    furniture = c(chairs = 8, tables = 2, hammocks = 1))

to_do_list <- list(guests = c("Uncle Bob", "Friendly neighbour", "Joe Best"),
                   invited = c(F,F,T),
                   items = party_items)
```

This confirms the observation that either the `[[]]` or `$` syntax extracts the values stored in an element of a list and are equivalent.


Thanks to the `$` and assignment operators one can simplify printing the drinks for the party.

```{r list-dollar-show, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="listDollarSetup", exercise.lines=2 }
to_buy <- to_do_list$items
to_buy$drinks
```

<!-- =============================== -->

## Conversion of lists to vectors {#conversion-of-lists-to-vectors}

<!-- =============================== -->

A list can be coerced into a vector using the `unlist()` function.
It uses the same coercion rules that `c()` uses to create homogeneous types for each element.

```{r, using-unlist-to-convert-list-to-vector, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=5}
set.seed(6728)
a_list <- list(labels=LETTERS[1:5], runs=1:5, outcomes=sample(1:10, size = 5))
str(a_list)
vector_version <- unlist(a_list)
str(vector_version)
```
