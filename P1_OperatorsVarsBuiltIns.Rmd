<!-- ======================== -->
## What you will learn
<!-- ======================== -->

By the end of this tutorial, you will know the basics of R operators and operator precedence, how to store values in variables, how to find and use built-in functions to get things done quickly, and how to get help within R.
<!-- Chances are there is already a function to do what you need.  -->
Armed with this knowledge you will be able to use R at the command line as a powerful programmable calculator or in a script file as and automation tool.

In another tutorial of this series you will learn the syntax to create your own functions.
This will be fundamental to avoid repetitive code and to write more readable programs.
The R base package has 1403 built-in functions and there are many thousands of R Packages available in
CRAN, the public R repository with packages to carry out many types of computation and even whole frameworks like the tidyverse. If you still need to write something specific to your analysis, R has you covered with
plain R syntax and the possibility to seamlessly integrate C++ or Rust code in your functions for added performance.

Our main goal with this tutorial is to teach patterns of the R language basic syntax, also called the dollar syntax. 
We believe this knowledge will set you on a positive trajectory at any point in your R language journey. 
R has specific properties that set it apart from other languages and can make it easier to learn for a beginner. 
However, those same differences can make it confusing at first for people with experience in other languages.



<!-- ======================== -->
## About this tutorial
<!-- ======================== -->

This introductory tutorial about the base R syntax can be used as a presentation by an instructor or as a self-study guide. 
It contains explanations, fully functional code boxes, and quizzes that make it interactive. 
When time allows during a guided session, the student can edit and execute code to test how the syntax works. 
This provides invaluable hands-on feedback. 
The instructor may also ask short questions regarding the material.
Should you fall behind or need more time for the exercises and quizzes, please complete them after the live session.
This is very important in order to cement the concepts and challenge your understanding.

The emphasis of this tutorial is on why R works the way it does and less on being a reference manual or a source of recipes. In doing so we hope to get you excited about this useful and expressive language. R was designed from the ground up to be vectorized and object oriented. Its aim is to be useful for both experts and beginners with the need to do computational statistics, data analysis and data visualization tasks.

Several sources describe the three types of R Syntax [@RSyntax-Cheatsheet], [@RSyntaxComparison-Cheatsheet]: the dollar sign, the formula, and the Tidyverse. These syntaxes are interchangeable, the important thing is to be consistent when using them. The formula syntax tends to be more compact but less readable while the Tidyverse syntax is more readable but also more verbose. We will focus on the dollar syntax.
<!-- Later we introduce the formula syntax and finally the tidyverse syntax. -->

This tutorial was built entirely in R using a package called `learnr`. It was compiled to an html document using Rmarkdown syntax and the `Knitr` package. If you receive the source code and have RStudio (Posit), you can render it as a fully interactive web page. Using an Rstudio solution it can also be deployed on a ShinyR server. You can also do these things and much more if you move forward in your R journey.

Finally, if you are following this material in a browser, every time you reopen the tutorial, it will be in the same state you left it the last time you worked on it. That means the code you have run, the answers to the quizzes you have worked, and the sections you have visited will be remembered. If you want to reset this information, erasing all of your previous history, press the `Start Over` option at the bottom left on the main panel. 

Let's get started.



<!-- ======================== -->
## Operators in R
<!-- ======================== -->

R has a console to interact with it. Let's use it as a calculator to add two numbers. 

Here is an example of a line of code to add two plus two and the resulting output:

```{r two-plus-two, echo=TRUE}
2 + 2
```

Note the output, there is a [1] and the result of the calculation. We will address the meaning of the number between square brackets when discussing `Vectors`. For now pretend it tells you the position of the single answer provided: a `[1]` indicates that the number `4` is the first value in the answer.


## Mathematical operators in R

Please try running the following lines of code, each representing a different mathematical operation.   

```{r operators-1, exercise=TRUE}
# white space between operands and operator does not matter below, try it!
450 - 100 # subtraction
3 * 10 # multiplication
35 / 7 # division
5^2 #exponentiation
```

Each result appears on its own line after running the code. The `#` symbol precedes a comment that is ignored by the interpreter of the code. This is the same behaviour you would see on a command line if you entered the four lines of code. Go back and prove to yourself that white space between the numbers and the operators has no effect on the result.

There are many more operators. We will now go over some of the most important and show how to search for all of the ones that R offers so you can find them when you need them.

## Relational operators

These operators have R compute numerical equality or inequality between objects. Don't get intimidated by the word objects: in R everything is an object, although some appear to be just numeric values. 

The basic relational operators compute equality or the lack of it:  "is equal" `==`, "is not equal" `!=`; and inequality in either direction with "is less than" `<` and "is greater than" `>`. 

```{r relational-operators, exercise = TRUE}
18 == 3 * 6
6 < 10
12 > 5
9 != 3 * 3
```

What about text comparisons? Text is written between double quotes, it contain letters, numbers, white space, and other special characters like punctuation. Execute the following lines of code.

```{r relational-operators-with-text, exercise=TRUE}
"Calgary Flames" == "Edmonton Oilers"
"Susan" > "Anne"
"a" < "b"
"Airport" != "Bus station"
```
The previous comparisons work because R uses the ASCII values of the characters on the text to compute numbers. The `a` comes before the `b` so its value is lower and thus the result observed above.

Can you go back and transform the arguments, not the operators, in the code above to reverse the results?
For example `"d" < "b"` for line 3 to produce `FALSE`.

<!-- roundoff error using the equality operator deferred for later when we have covered functions --> 

## Logical operators

These operators are used to combine the results of two or more relational operators into a single result. Here is the AND operator represented in R by the ampersand symbol `&`:

```{r logical-AND-exercise, exercise=TRUE, collapse=TRUE}
5 > 3 & 5 < 8
5 > 3 & 5 != 5
5 < 4 & 5 > 1
5 < 4 & 5 > 7
```
Can you make a table with the truth values of the relational operators before they were combined with the logical operator AND?

```{r logical-table-AND, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=1}
# Run Code to see the table"
library(knitr)
and = c("&", "&", "&", "&")
equals = c("=", "=", "=" , "=")
relation1 <- c("5 > 3", "5 > 3", "5 < 4", "5 < 4") 
value1 <- c(paste0("(", 5 > 3, ")"), 
            paste0("(", 5 > 3, ")"),
            paste0("(", 5 < 4, ")"),
            paste0("(", 5 < 4, ")"))
relation2 <- c("5 < 8", "5 != 5", "5 > 1", "5 > 7")
value2 <- c(paste0("(", 5 < 8, ")"),
            paste0("(", 5 != 5, ")"),
            paste0("(", 5 > 1, ")"),
            paste0("(", 5 > 7, ")"))
result = c(5 > 3 & 5 < 8,
           5 > 3 & 5 != 5, 
           5 < 4 & 5 > 1, 
           5 < 4 & 5 > 7)

kable( data.frame(relation1, value1, and, relation2, value2, equals, result, 
                 stringsAsFactors = FALSE),
       col.names = c("rel1", "(value)", "", "rel2", "(value)", "", "result"),
       align = 'rlcrlcl',
       caption = 'Truth table for AND')
```


For the logical OR operator, represented in R by the pipe symbol `|`, the table would look as follows:

```{r logical-table-OR, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=1}
# Run Code to see the table"
library(knitr)
and = c("|", "|", "|", "|")
equals = c("=", "=", "=" , "=")
relation1 <- c("5 > 3", "5 > 3", "5 < 4", "5 < 4") 
value1 <- c(paste0("(", 5 > 3, ")"), 
            paste0("(", 5 > 3, ")"),
            paste0("(", 5 < 4, ")"),
            paste0("(", 5 < 4, ")"))
relation2 <- c("5 < 8", "5 != 5", "5 > 1", "5 > 7")
value2 <- c(paste0("(", 5 < 8, ")"),
            paste0("(", 5 != 5, ")"),
            paste0("(", 5 > 1, ")"),
            paste0("(", 5 > 7, ")"))
result = c(5 > 3 | 5 < 8,
           5 > 3 | 5 != 5, 
           5 < 4 | 5 > 1, 
           5 < 4 | 5 > 7)

kable( data.frame(relation1, value1, and, relation2, value2, equals, result, 
                 stringsAsFactors = FALSE),
       col.names = c("rel1", "(value)", "", "rel2", "(value)", "", "result"),
       align = 'rlcrlcl',
       caption = 'Truth table for OR')
```

Finally the negation or NOT logical operator is represented in R by the exclamation mark `!`. It negates or turns the logical value into its opposite.

```{r negation-logical-operator, exercise=TRUE}
!(-4 > 0 )

```

Thanks to the parenthesis the negation operator can be applied to the result of a more complex logical operation on the results of two relational operators.

```{r negation-logical-operator-complex-exp, exercise=TRUE}
!(-4 > 0  & 0 > 1)

```


The relational operators require numbers while the logical operators require true or false values. What does R do when a logical operator is applied to a number? Let's assume that the parenthesis is left out accidentally from the previous expression.


```{r negation-precedence, exercise=TRUE}
!-4 > 0  & 0 > 1
```
As it turns out R coerces a value of `0` to `FALSE` and any non-zero to `TRUE` when in need to calculate using a logical operator, like `!` on -4. Thus the expression `!-4` translates into `!TRUE = FALSE = 0`, which in turn makes `!-4 > 0` into `0 > 0` and therefore it computes `FALSE`.

The change in final result depending on the order of evaluation of the operators brings us into the subject of operator precedence.


## Operator precedence

Operators that act on a single value are _unary_ while those that receive two arguments are _binary_. The execution order of an expression containing several operators follows the rules of operator precedence. These rules determine the  priority of execution given to some operators over others. Let's look at an example:

```{r op-precendence-A, exercise=TRUE}
# predict the result computed by R before pressing the Run Code button
1 + 5 * 5
```

Did you predict the result correctly? For R, multiplication takes precedence over addition. 

You can force the execution of addition over multiplication by use of parenthesis as illustrated below:

```{r op-precendence-B, exercise=TRUE}
# predict the new result using parenthesis around the addition operator
(1 + 5) * 5
```

To learn about the rules of precedence built into R you can use its help system. 
Here is a list of all the _unary_ and _binary_ operators and their precedence order from highest to lowest from top to bottom and from left to right within groups:


```{r op-precedence-2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=1}
# Run Code to see the table"
library(knitr)
kable(data.frame(operator_groups = c(":: :::",
                               "$ @",
                               "[ [[",
                               "^",
                               "- +",
                               ":",
                               "%any%",
                               "* /",
                               "+ -",
                               "< > <= >= == !=",
                               "!",
                               "& &&",
                               "| ||",
                               "~",
                               "-> ->>",
                               "<- <<-",
                               "=",
                               "?"),
description = c("access variables in a namespace",
                "component / slot extraction",
                "indexing",
                "exponentiation (right to left)",
                "unary minus and plus",
                "sequence operator",
                "special operators (including %% and %/%)",
                "multiply, divide",
                "(binary) add, subtract",
                "ordering and comparison",
                "negation",
                "and",
                "or",
                "as in formulae",
                "rightwards assignment",
                "assignment (right to left)",
                "assignment (right to left)",
                "help (unary and binary)")))
```

You can get documentation like this from the R help at the command line by typing `?Syntax` or `help("Syntax")`, a full set of help functions appears on the table below. 


```{r help-commands, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=1}
# Run Code to see the table"
library(knitr)
long_form <- c("help.start()", "help(\"funABC\")", "help.search(\"funABC\")", "example(\"funABC\")", "RSiteSearch()","apropos(\"funABC\", mode = \"function\")", "data()", "vignette()", "vignette(\"ABC\")") 
short_form <- c("", "?funABC", "??funABC", "", "", "", "", "", "")
description = c("General help system",
                "Help on function \"funABC\" (quotations optional)",
                "Searches help for string \"funABC\"",
                "Finds examples for \"funABC\"",
                "Opens a browser search for \"funABC\" on R online manuals and archived mailing lists",
                "List of all avaliable functions with \"funABC\" in their name",
                "List all data sets in loaded packages",
                "List vignettes for currently installed packages",
                "Displays content of vignette for package \"ABC\"")

kable( data.frame(long_form, short_form, description, 
                 stringsAsFactors = FALSE),
       caption = 'Help commands explained [@KabacoffRobert2015Ria, p.11]')
```

<!-- ======================== -->
## Variables in R
<!-- ======================== -->

Just like in mathematics and statistics, the concept of variables is that of a placeholder for values. In R or any other programming language it is a good idea to store results in variables so we can keep them around to use them in other expressions. Here is an exercise to declare and assign values to variables.

```{r storing-values, exercise.lines=7, exercise=TRUE}
# store a value
a <- 10
# store the result of an operation
b <- a + 5
# print the contents 'a' and 'b' one on separate lines
a
b
```

The `<-` binary operator indicates assignment. The value on the right is assigned to the variable on the left. After line 1 is executed by R the variable `a` stores the value 10. When the second line is executed, `b` is assigned the result of applying the operator `+` to the value of the variable `a`, `10`, and the value `5`. As a result of this, `b` will be assigned the value `15`.

The operator assignment has subtleties in R that we will cover when addressing the subject of functions and their arguments.


<!-- ======================== -->
## Test your understanding
<!-- ======================== -->

```{r quiz-simple-assignment, echo=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
quiz(
  question("What is the value of b after executing the following R code?
  
          a <- 5
  
          b <- a * (34 - 22) / 1 + 1",
  answer("12"),
  answer("30"),
  answer("61", correct = TRUE),
  answer("149"),
  allow_retry = TRUE,
  random_answer_order = TRUE,
  try_again = "Check the operator precedence table and try again."
  )
)
```



## Variables and objects

In R the name used to label a variable is an object itself [@RLangDef.objects], in fact everything is an object in R and in this tutorial we will refer to objects and variables interchangeably.

Variables have types in R. The built-in function `typeof()` can be used to get the type of any object. Let's explore types in the next section.


## Finding the type of a variable

By observing the type that R associates with some values we can start to appreciate how R works internally.

```{r type-of-variables, exercise=TRUE}
i <- 54
typeof(i)
j <- 54L
typeof(j)
x <- 3.1416
typeof(x)
first_name <- "Rob"
typeof(first_name)
```

Let's investigate the type of the R function `typeof` itself.

```{r mode-of-mode, exercise=TRUE}
typeof(typeof)
```

In computer language _lingo_ a closure is a function and the environment to evaluate it, let's leave it at that for now. R is a unique language in more ways than one, let's move on with more basic concepts.


## Built-in functions

R offers predefined functions. When you use an R package you also use functions to get many complex tasks done with ease. It is important to familiarize yourself with their syntax. This requires that we start simple and build up the concepts gradually. The goal is to learn how to pass information to them and how to obtain results in two forms: as direct returned objects or as side effects. A side effect would be something like a file being written to the local disk or to a file service in the cloud.



## Assignment from built-ins 

Expressions can be made by assigning the value returned from a function to a variable. Let's look at the result of running the following lines:

```{r executing-function, exercise=TRUE}
# assign the result of the function call to the variable 'e'
e <- exp(1)
# print the contents of 'e' to the output
e
```

The first line executes the expression on the right of the assignment operator, itself a function call to `exp()` with argument `1` and assigns the returned value to the variable `e`. The second line prints the value stored in `e` as `2.718282`.

Try running the line 1 by itself below.

```{r executing-function-oneline, exercise=TRUE}
e <- exp(1)
```

There should be no output. The value of the function `exp` with the argument `1` was computed and stored in the variable `e`. The assignment operation leaves no trace on the output. Another way of saying this is _the assignment operator produces no side effects in the console_. Its only effect is to create a name-value pair,  <span style="color:red">(e, 2.718282)</span> in the global environment, so the value can be recalled later by its assigned name.

*Note:* As it is usually the case in R, there is more than one way of getting things done. You can get a two-for-one effect by printing and doing assignment in a single expression on the console by surrounding the assignment with parenthesis. Try it!

```{r two-for-one,  exercise = TRUE}
# this accomplishes the assignment and prints the value of the variable in one line
(e <- exp(1))  # Euler's constant in R
```

## Other built-in functions

To compute logarithms, R offers the following predefined functions:

```
     log(x, base = exp(1))
     logb(x, base = exp(1))
     log10(x)
     log2(x)
     
     log1p(x)
```

The most fundamental R built-in functions come bundled in the `base` package.
To read about an R package use the function call `library(help = "base")` at the command line. Packages are loaded by issuing the function `libray("base")`  but the `base` package is loaded by default when an R session is started. Try it below.

```{r functions-base-package, exercise=TRUE}
library(help = "base")
```

The language R provides a standard work-flow to build packages that contain functions, variables, and data targeting a specific problem. Contributors write R packages and share them mainly via the CRAN repository. To find out what comes built-in with the `base` package we can call the 
`builtins()` function to produce the list of `r length(builtins())` objects that are loaded in the base environment when you start R the first time.

```{r number-functions-base-package, exercise=TRUE}
# get the number of objects loaded from the base R package
length(builtins())
# test if a object (a function) is part of the built-ins in the base environment
"exp" %in% builtins()
```


<!-- ======================== -->
## Test your understanding
<!-- ======================== -->

```{r quiz-complex-expressions, echo=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
quiz(
    question("Consider the expression: 
  
            a <- 1 + log10(10)
  
  What is the result of executing the line above in the R console?",
    answer("the value 2 gets assigned to _a_ and printed to the console", message = "the operaror _assignment_ has no side effects so nothing should be printed to the console"),
    answer("error, _log10_ of 10 is undefined", message = "That's not quite right, check your the definition of a logarithm and try again"),
    answer("nothing gets printed", correct = TRUE, message = "The operator _assignment_ has no side effects so nothing gest printed after the value 2 gets associated with the variable _a_"),
    answer("the value of _a_ gets printed", message = "The operator _assignment_ has no other effect than to associate a value with a variable name"),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    random_answer_order = TRUE
  )
)
```



## The assignment operators

Experiment now to compute logarithms in base 10 and natural logarithms (base _e_). Try to answer the following: 

 - What is the logarithm of 10 in base 10?
 - What is the natural logarithm of _e_?
 - What is the logarithm of 512 in base 2?
 
Try using the two variables already predefined in the first two lines. Add as many lines of code as you need to experiment.

```{r other-operators, exercise=TRUE}
a <- 10
e = exp(1)

print(paste0("a = ", a, "; e = ", round( x = e, digits = 4)))

# logarithm of 10 in base 10

# natural logarithm of e

# binary logarithm of 512

```

```{r other-operators-hint}
log10(a)
log(e)
log(512, base = 2)
```

From the previous exercise you might have noticed that the operators `<-` and `=` behave identically in stand alone expressions. Technically speaking, their effect is to create name-value pairs for each variable,  <span style="color:red">(_a_, 10)</span> and  <span style="color:red">(_e_, 2.7183)</span>, in the global environment.

So, you might ask: why are there two operators to do the same in R?
Read on for the answer.

## Named and positional arguments 

R functions may be built-in or user created, they may also have none, one, or more arguments. The arguments are given in between parenthesis, separated by commas, and they may be named or not. An example of a named parameter to a function is `base` in the `log` function: `log(x, base = exp(1))`. Examine the code below and guess the output before running it, did you expect the result?

```{r named-param-1, exercise = TRUE}
(three <- log(1000, base = 10))
# un-comment to check if base exists after executing the line above
# base
```

<!-- ```{r named-param-1, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines=9}
three <- log(1000, base = 10)
 
# Does 'base' exist in the global environment after log gets valuated?
# let's  check it out and print a nice message accordingly
if (exists("base")) {
  print(paste0("base exists outside of log, base = ", base)) 
} else {
   print("base does not exist outside of log")
}
```--->

In the call to the function `log`, the first argument is positional, taking exactly the position number one. The second argument is named and may receive a value via the `=` operator for assignment from right to left.

If the function is called without a second argument, and if `base` is required for computation inside the function, the assignment operator will use the value resulting from evaluating the expression `exp(1)` and associate it with `base` because that is how the built-in function is defined. This is how a default value is defined for a named argument. 

If the user prefers to pass a different value from the default then the named argument can be given as in `log(10, base = 10)` or just  `log(10, 10)`. 

```{r named-param-2, exercise = TRUE}
# use the name for the second argument
log(1000, base = 10)
# use only a value for the second argument, still ok!
log(1000, 10)
```

Now compare the flexibility of using the explicit name assignment.

```{r named-param-3, exercise = TRUE}
# the first argument is now a named argument so the second gets position one instead
log(base = 10, 1000)
# in absence of hints, x = 10 (position one) and base = 1000 (named)
log(10, 1000)
```

## More on variable assignment

We already saw how the `=` operator for a named argument does not affect the global environment where the function is created. Variable assignment is like creating a pair (variable-name, expression) that lives in a scope where it can be reached for further evaluation.

We could use the `<-` operator for the named argument, the expression `log(x, base <- exp(1))` would assign the expression `exp(1)` to the local variable `base`. However, before that gets done, the name-expression pair gets created in the global environment. That implies that there will be a global variable `base` with the value of evaluating `exp(1)` outside of the function `log` after exiting `log`. Let's test that. 

```{r named-param-4, exercise = TRUE}
base = 100
log(1000, base = 10)
# What value does 'base' have in the global environment after log gets evaluated?
base
# Try un-commenting the lines below and compare
# log(1000, base <- 10)
# base
```

<!-- ```{r named-param-4, exercise = TRUE}
log(1000, base <- 10)
# Does 'base' exist in the global environment after log gest evaluated?
if (exists("base")) {
  print(paste0("base exists outside of log, base = ", base)) 
} else {
  print("base does not exist outside of log")
}
``` -->


If we use the global assignment operator `<-` in the first position it might have an unexpected result compared to using the local assignment operator `=`.  Check for yourself with the code below.

```{r named-param-5, exercise = TRUE}
log(base <- 10, 1000)
# try now using the local assignment = for the named parameter
log(base = 10, 1000)
```

Why does `base <- 10` not do the named argument assignment the same way `base = 10` does? The reason is the scope of the name-value pair `(base, 10)` created by `base <- 10`. The scope of this definition is the global environment outside of the function `log`. The function does no receive a variable definition `(base, 10)` to work with internally. Instead of that it sees the value `10` in position 1.

In summary, to avoid ambiguities and unexpected side effects, when assigning values to variables use `<-` for stand-alone expressions and `=` for named parameters. On the next section there are a few exercises to solidify these concepts.


Note: as a side bar if you need to write a robust function that behaves like `log` check out the reference [@wrapr-named-arguments] (Consult the References section at the end of this document.)


## On number representation (Adv.)

Computers can only store and operate on numbers in the binary system, meaning only with two states that we will call  "off" and "on" or zeros and ones. Due to this limitation there are round off errors intrinsic to the arithmetic of converting from binary to decimal, a counting system we humans are more familiar with. Let's investigate the problem and find a solution in R [@CRAN.FAQ.RDoesNotThinkNumbersAreEqual].

```{r round-off-error, exercise=TRUE}
0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 == 0.3
```

Wait a second, no one saw that one coming! Let's explore what is happening and why. First let's try to see the decimal representation of these numeric types.

```{r printing-double-at-max-resolution, exercise=TRUE}
print(0.1, digits = 17)
print(0.3, digits = 17)
```
Let's investigate now what the machine's precision to represent a double floating point number from the R documentation on the meaning of `double.eps` from the constant `.Machine` (you can summon the documentation with `help(.Machine)`:

```{r floating-point-precision, exercise=TRUE}
# using the R constant .Machine, find out more with help(".Machine")
(.Machine$double.base ^ .Machine$double.ulp.digits) / 2
```
This means that this is the smallest number that will make this expression `FALSE`: `1 + x == 1`:

```{r precision-double-test, exercise=TRUE}
1 + 1.00e-16 == 1
1 + 1.11e-16 == 1
1 + 1.12e-16 == 1
```
To avoid the round-off error when making these kind of comparisons it is recommended to use a built-in function that considers the machine precision of doubles: `all.equal()`.

```{r how-to-avoid-round-off-error, exercise=TRUE}
sum_calc <- 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 
sum_expected <- 0.3
all.equal(sum_calc, sum_expected)
```
